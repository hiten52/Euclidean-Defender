#  Euclidean Defender
In this game, you play the role of a defense engineer at a missile manufacturing company. Due to a critical fault in the testing phase, missiles are being launched uncontrollably and are escaping the company's premises. Your mission is to protect the world by intercepting these rogue missiles before they can cause any harm.

The twist? Each missile follows a predetermined mathematical function as its trajectory. Your task is to analyze and guess the trajectory, then deploy Defense System Rockets (DSR) to intercept and destroy the missiles.

Will you be able to decode the patterns and save the day?
